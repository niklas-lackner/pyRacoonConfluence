# Backup Directory for pyRacoonConfluence

This directory contains timestamped backups of RACOON publication pages.

## File Naming Convention

- `racoon_publications_sso_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html` - SSO authentication backups
- `racoon_publications_with_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html` - Test operation backups

## Automatic Cleanup

Backup files are automatically created before any changes to Confluence pages.
Consider periodic cleanup of old backup files to manage disk space.

## Note

Backup files (*.html) are excluded from Git commits for security and space reasons,
but this directory structure is maintained in the repository.
